Q17:
17.1Q: What class should implement the Comparable interface?
17.1A: The class that represents the media items should implement the Comparable interface. This would include classes like DigitalVideoDisc, CD, and Book that are stored in the Cart.

17.2Q: In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method to reflect the ordering that we want?
17.2A: You should define the comparison logic in the compareTo() method based on the criteria you want (e.g., comparing by title and cost).

17.3Q: Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
17.3A: No, the Comparable interface allows only one natural ordering. If you need multiple orderings, use a separate Comparator for each rule.

17.4Q: Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
17.4A: Define a custom comparison rule for DVDs by overriding the compareTo() method in the DigitalVideoDisc class. If I need to apply different rules for different media types, I will use a custom comparator that checks the type of the media item and applies the suitable ordering.
